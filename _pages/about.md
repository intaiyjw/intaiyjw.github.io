Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Nice to meet you! I am a master student in Information Systems Security, and my current base is Montreal, Canada. I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic Science and Technology at <a href="https://english.tyut.edu.cn">Taiyuan University of Technology</a>.

__Research Interests:__ Based on an academic background of extensive disciplines, I have been holding a broad interests in hardware, security, machine learning, as well as mathematics and physics. I holds a belief that all research subjects are connected with each other in a higher abstract level, and conform to common principles in one meta-area. In my research, for example, the ideas in machine learning has been enlightened by physics, and relied on statistics heavily; machine learning, statistical physics and information theories seems to be different facets of one body in some manner. The beauty of this uniformity has driven me into deeper and further research. My current focus is:

- Machine Learning: Probabilistic graphic model, generative topic model, approximate bayesian inference
